# PasswordGenerator

Homework assignment 3

This is a random password generator that, when the user clicks the "generate password" button, will generate a random password based on the users input and when the user clicks "copy to clipboard", it will copy the created password to the users clipboard.

Before the password is generated, the user will be prompted for the character length (8 to 128) and confirm whether they want numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or special characters. After all the input critera is filled by the user, the program will generate a random password based on their input.
